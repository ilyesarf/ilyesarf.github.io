A poorly written pseudocode that describes Quimzy's day.

```
function think(topics) is
  topic = a random topic from topics
  idea = a random idea from that topic 
  return idea

function brain() is
  topics = [physics, math, computer_science]  
  idea = think(topics)
  if idea.type() = theory is
    wonder(idea) //too lazy to write a function for this right now
  else
    create(idea)

function quimzy() is
  tasks = []
  while len(tasks) > 3 //limit of tasks changes according to energy
    brain()
    add 1 to tasks

quimzy()
````
I've found myself thinking about a lot of things, so why not tell some of them to the world.

You can find the stuff i've built on <a href="https://github.com/Quimzy"> my Github </a>


I am also a noob scientist, interested in Math, AI & the future.
