When the singularity happens, all of us would be unemployed. And, i literally mean *ALL OF US*. The next 10-15 years are the best years to work in tech and actually contribute something. And, of course that time-span is valid for people who work with AI directly or inderectly (i.e building infrastructure for AI). 

But, for CRUD devs and "software engineers", it's gonna take 5 years (maybe less!) for AI to figure out a way to translate business requirements into code. Once AI is able to do that; most coding channels on Youtube would vanish, it would take few months to a year for small-mid companies to get rid of their developement team. It would take two or three years for big "tech" companies to get rid of most of their developers as well.

If you think that this is far fetched, i'd like to mention that we already have the <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot">basic technology</a> to make this work but it needs some few tweaks. And, once someone finds a way to do it, he's gonna be the most hated person by devs. And, honestly, i don't mind hate if it's for the sake of a better future and better technology. I wanna build an AI that builds me a spaceship so i can travel the universe, if creating an AI coder would help me to do so, i will do it.

Few years from now, a 6th grade kid would go to a platform and write a description of a dynamic website that he would like to make, the AI generates the code, hosts it on AWS and returns the link for the website in less than a day. It would be having a nice UI/UX, a database, APIs, and a backend.

Now let's see how much time it would take the ***kid*** to make the website:
- Learning basic web stuff: HTML & CSS & JS (3 months)
- Learning MERN stack (6 months)
- Learning AWS (1 month)
- Learning some security stuff (1 month)
- Connecting all the stuff together (1 month)

**So it would take a 12 year old kid around a year to make a dynamic website.**

And don't get me started on how AI is more efficient than humans, the whole thing could be describe in one scentence said by George Hotz: "**Computers don't get drunk**".
